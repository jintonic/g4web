# Contributing to [Project Name]

Thank you for your interest in contributing! To maintain code quality and consistency, please follow these guidelines.

## Development Workflow

### Dependency Management

We use `package-lock.json` to ensure deterministic builds across all environments.

- **Always commit your lockfile:** If you add, remove, or update a dependency, include the updated `package-lock.json` in your commit.
- **Do not edit manually:** This file is automatically generated by npm; manual edits can lead to corruption.

### Code Style & Formatting

We use **Prettier** to enforce a consistent coding style.

- **Automated Formatting:** Run `npm run format` before committing your changes.
- **Vendor Code:** Do not format files in the `vendor/` directory. These are excluded via `.prettierignore` to prevent merge conflicts with upstream libraries like Three.js.

We have included a .vscode/ configuration folder. If you are using VS Code, Antigravity, or Cursor, the editor will automatically adopt our formatting standards and suggest the required extensions.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed in `package.json`.
2. Verify that your code passes the Prettier check (`npx prettier --check .`).
3. Update the documentation if you are introducing new features or changing existing workflows.
